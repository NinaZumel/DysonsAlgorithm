# DysonsAlgorithm
Freeman Dyson's algorithm for solving the generalized 12 coins puzzle.

Dyson, Freeman J. "Note 1931--The problem of the pennies," *The Mathematical Gazette* Vol. 30, No 291) (October 1946). [JSTOR link](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3611225)

My writeups on the algorithm:

* [The special case when $M = (3^n - 3)/2$](https://ninazumel.com/blog/2024-10-23-dysons-algorithm/) (M the number of coins, n the number of weighings). This is the case for 12 coins in 3 weighings.

* [The general case when $3 \leq M \leq (3^n - 3)/2$](https://ninazumel.com/pages/extra/dysons-algorithm-general/)
